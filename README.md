A fun attempt to detect patterns and make predictions in the chaos that is Major League Baseball. The model factors statistics relating to
the batting lineup, starting pitching, and bullpen in a very general way. Currently, only games played by the Angels are considered. To run a
simulation, simply run v1.py; the ouput will be in the form of "Away Runs: (# of runs), Home Runs: (# of runs)", where "Away" and "Home" is with
respect to the Angels.
