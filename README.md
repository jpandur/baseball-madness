A fun attempt to detect patterns and make predictions in the chaos that is Major League Baseball. The model created in files starting with v1 factors statistics relating to the batting lineup, starting pitching, and bullpen in a very general way. To run a simulation, simply run v1.py; the ouput will be in the form of "Away Runs: (# of runs), Home Runs: (# of runs)". The model created in files starting with v2 is a bit more detailed; it considers how each batter and pitcher does in certain situations (i.e. with certain basepaths and number of outs) to make its prediction.
