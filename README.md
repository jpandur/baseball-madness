This project serves as a fun attempt to detect patterns and make predictions in the chaos that is Major League Baseball. Player data from previous seasons is not used, since performance can wildly fluctuate from season to season. Factors that are used to determine outcomes include the weather, ballpark factors (e.g. the dimensions of the park), pitching performances during the last four weeks, batting performances during the last two weeks, and season statistics in different situations (e.g. basepaths/outs, platoon splits). 1000 simulations are run, and the following things are outputted: average runs scored per team, average spread, standard deviation of total runs scored, and standard deviation of the spread. The total runs scored and spread can be treated as approximately normal distributions.
